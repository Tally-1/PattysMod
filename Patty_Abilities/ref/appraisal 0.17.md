<!-- 1) 
Keybindings tab is not showing the scroll wheel keybind

<!-- 2) 
The Resupply Crate placed by a player still displays as Bright Green for the Owner on the map.
3D Marker functions as intended.

<!-- 3) 
Owner of the Crate should only be able to Retreive the Crate by directly interacting with the crate and picking it up.
Make sure the option is not displayed for other players or people who share the same ability. -->

<!-- 4) 
When the Resupply Crate is Contested the Map Marker reverts to the old iteration where it says "supplyCrate (Contested)"
Even after securing the Crate the text will revert back to just supplyCrate and the old Green color.

5) 
I'd like the Special Ability option within Self Interactions to never dissappear for any role that has an ability.
Instead the ability inside there should change its color depending on its status.

Red = Destroyed/Cooldown
Orange = Placed/in-use
White = Avaliable for usage

<!-- 6) 
The beeping noise plays when the Crate is successfully destroyed by the enemy.
We already have a Notification so no need for a beeping noise. -->

<!-- 7) 
Move all 3D Markers to be above the crate's like our old crate in the picture below.
Once again this is for all 3D Markers currently implemented and future 3D markers for all abilities. -->
