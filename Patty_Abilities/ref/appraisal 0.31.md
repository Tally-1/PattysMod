1) Incorrect marker design when hovering over Resupply Crate when Contested

If the Resupply Crate is contested if the player hovers over it on the map it resets back to just Resupply Crate with the default icon.
It returns to normal when you move the mouse back off it again.

2) Incorrect Contested Marker Mechanic

The Design of the Resupply Crate Map Marker on the map is a little off as well.
When Contested the Resupply Crate should just display the Red Resupply Crate Icon on the map with no text and when hovered over then say the full text of "Resupply Crate (Contested)"

Basically exactly the same way it works normally but a slight design change when Contested.
