Alright, I finally got time to test the latest version and it seems we once again had a few misunderstandings or you may have forgotten some of the things I've mentioned.

Once again good work so far. 

While you did miss a few things the rest made it in perfectly. 
But let's try to speed this up and get this over with and most importantly get it right so we do not need to go back and forth over and over again until it is done.

(1) 

I mentioned that the Arsenal Crate and the Resupply Crate currently are just called "supplyCrate" and I wanted you to change the names of these crates to Arsenal Crate and Resupply Crate.

(2) 

The Arsenal Crate is not using the right AC Icon but instead using the RC icon.

I've given you an explanation of each image file name and what they are meant for below.

AC (Arsenal Icon) 

is meant only for the Arsenal Crate and will be displayed as a 3D Marker and Map Marker.

RC (Resupply Icon) 

This icon was only to be displayed for the Resupply Crate or the Crate placed down in the Editor. 
This icon would also show up as the ACE Interaction for Resupplying loadout for all crates. ( Image Below )

The RC Icon was also meant to replace the box icon you currently use to allow players to place down the Resupply crate.

SA (Special Ability Icon) 

This was supposed to replace the "A" icon within ACE Self Interaction for Special Abilities.

(3)

The map color of the player placed down Resupply crate was meant to be Bright Green but this one is more on me for not being clear enough.

The animation for placing down the crate works but there is one issue where the animation speeds up every time it finishes until the bar is full. I think it would be better if you slowed it down so that the animation ends right as the bar is full rather than continuously playing.

If this is not possible or too time-consuming simply just let the animation finish and don't make it replay at all. 
ACE does this already normally for plenty of actions so it won't stick out in my group.

These icons should also be using the RC icon that I mentioned above.

As mentioned in (1) instead of saying supplyCrate this should say "Resupply Crate (Contested)"

(6) Feature Change

If a player is contesting the Crate by standing near it when the enemy is close to it instead of deleting the timer have it pause. 
Basically, the timer stops counting down but it won't stop displaying as contested.

(7)

The cooldown timer only works in multiplayer. 
This is more of a small issue but would be nice to have fixed.

There also is an issue where the notification that was supposed to display when the cooldown was over and the ability can be used again did not show up both in Multiplayer or Singleplayer.

For future information, I'd like the priority to be to make sure it works on a dedicated server but for testing also works in Singleplayer.
I usually do the first round of testing on either LAN or Singleplayer. 
Once the mod is good to go I run the final tests on Dedicated to make sure there are no issues with multiple players.

The notification that was supposed to display when the cooldown was over did not show up both in Multiplayer or Singleplayer.

(8) New Feature

 Would be nice if you could add the ability to rotate the crate using the mouse wheel.
 I definitely feel a need for this and i bet somebody will mention this to me at some point.
