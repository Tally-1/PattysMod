**Comment on time estimation**
The estimates below are very rough and I usually underestimate the time something takes.
The main reason for this is that new complexity emerges during development.
However Sometimes the oposite happens and I end up spending far less time on something than what I originally thought.
With this in mind I like to set a max-min limit on projects somewhere around the estimated time.

**General guidelines:**

1) Separate mod dependant on the Role-system (As a "DLC")
2) Abilities should be accesed through ACE menu (And vanilla?)
3) Add keybinding for instant Ability access (Optional?)
4) Abilities should be changeable mid-gameplay, and not locked to a role
5) Abilities can be assigned to a role in the mission Config
6) All customizable aspects of a role should be exposed in Addon options

**Pricing pr Ability:**
