1) Renaming Drones in Terminal

The names of the drones within the UAV Terminal still go under their vanilla name.
I would like you to do the same you did to the loading bar and make sure all Drones have their proper name displayed within.

This includes the "Combat Drone" thats currently called "ABILITIES Combat Drone" and not just "Combat Drone"
Below is an image of what im referring to and the proper names they should have:

"Bomb Drone"
"Recon Drone"
"Combat Drone"

2) Blowing up the Bomb Drone manually or when its disabled

Sometimes the Bomb Drone is shot down by the enemy but not destroyed.
This causes the drone to be unusable by the Drone Operator until it runs out of battery which only then does it go on cooldown.
Id like you to make sure that if the drone operator loses control over the drone aka the Bomb Drone becomes disabled it will automatically blow up.

Another failsafe Id like for you to do is to make the DETONATE button always visible even when the drone is not being controlled by the Operator.
That way if the player loses control of the drone then they can still detonate it using their action menu.
