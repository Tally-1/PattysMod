A more detailed list of things that need to be done with the Arsenal/Resupply Crate
This includes stuff from the previous list.

(1)

The animation you chose for picking up/placing/resupplying was only meant to be used for Resupplying.
I'd like you to replace the picking up and placing animation with this one.

(2)

The crate should only appear and disappear when the action is fully complete.
This means once the player is done picking up or placing the crate only then should it disappear.

(3)

I'd like for there to be a sound when resupplying and a sound for picking up/placing the crate
Some more audio feedback for the player

(4)

For the 3D markers and map markers that you use for the Resupply Crates, I'd like you to make a version for the Arsenal Crate.
No need to do anything special for the Arsenal Crate. I simply want the style to be consistent between the crates.
I've linked the icon I want you to use for the Arsenal Crate below. Make sure the name also displays "Arsenal"

(5)

I previously told you to use the ACE Menu as a reference.
I've changed my mind and I want you to mimic the menu design you already use for the Role Manager and Life Manager.
Remember this menu only shows the keybinds. No need to freeze them in place or anything.

(6)

Any player should be able to pause the Destruction timer on the Resupply Crate by standing close to it.

When the crate is being destroyed the 3D Marker and Map Marker should turn Red for everyone.
The Person who owns the ability will still be the only one with a notification and sound for when the crate is being destroyed.

There should be a sound when the crate is being contested that only the person who owns the ability can hear.

(7)

There needs to be a sound for when the crate is available to be placed again. as well. 
There should also be a notification for the Ability owner as well.

(8)

Here is a list of icons I need you to use.
2 for the Resupply Crate ability and one for the Special Ability ACE Interaction.

Arsenal Crate: https://gyazo.com/717548963a5e797bfe2aa1b3777a3a80
Resupply Crate: https://gyazo.com/b8c5f7a0d88ccdad404414ca4a8aa3ec
Special Ability ACE Tab: https://gyazo.com/306bf2f71b419041a433bdd69f185c27

Arsenal Crate should be Blue
Resupply Crate should be Green ( Yellow for the Ability Owner )
The crate when being destroyed should be Red for all players

(9) 

The 3d marker and map marker text need to be changed to what I've listed below.

Resupply Crate = Resupply Crate
Arsenal = Arsenal

The Crate placed in Editor/Zeus should mimic the Resupply crate entirely.
The only difference is the fact there is no owner and the Crate can be destroyed.

(10)

The Resupply ACE Interaction should use the icon below and should say "Resupply Loadout"
