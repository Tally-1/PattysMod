The Player cannot be spawned if Unconscious or Dead.
If the player is Dead or Unconscious disable the Respawn on that player temporarily.

When the player is no longer unconscious or has respawned the Respawn Point will return to normal.
Player Respawn will not have a Map Marker or 3D Marker in any form.

Keep in mind this ability will also need to be temporarily disabled during a Counter-Attack.
Simply remove it and place it back on the player once Counter-Attack is over similar to the other Respawn Points.
