1) Error message when placing Respawn

I'm not sure what it may be connected to.

2) Spacing in Role name

Roles such as Squad Leader or Radio Operator have spaces in them.
Currently, you display the role as "SquadLeader" in one word.
I can make adjustments to the class name if needed like "Squad_Leader" but if you can solve this on your end that would be perfect.

3) Zeus Respawn Point did not get deactivated

The title says it all. The 3D Marker and Map Marker were updated to say Deactivated.
When I respawn I still see the option to respawn on the position.

Rally Point functions as intended this is only the Zeus Module.

| Potential solution to the Respawn Name issue |

Mentions of people placing a Respawn Point with the correct name in here.
Feel free to give it a read to see if you could potentially solve our older issue.

| Alternative Solution to the Zeus Respawn Point |

Zeus Respawn put a wrench in the work which is why I have a simple solution to the problem.
You can revert the changes to the first iteration. This means no 3D Marker & Map Marker for the Zeus Respawn Module.
I should be able to make a makeshift solution on my end.

Leave the name as is. 
It's buggy and incredibly hard to fix no need to waste our time on it.

Afterward, all you gotta do is make the adjustments mentioned above related to the Rally Point and that should be everything.
