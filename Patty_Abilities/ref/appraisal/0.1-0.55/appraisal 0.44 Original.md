1) Bomb Drone Explosive Change

1 Explosive Charge is about around the balance that I would prefer.

2) Notification text correction

Top text is fine but make the description for the cooldown complete notification say:
"Recon Drone Available"
"Combat Drone Available"
"Bomb Drone Available"

The description for the drones when they go on cooldown is empty.
Make the text for each drone say this:

"Recon Drone Unavailable"
"Combat Drone Unavailable"
"Bomb Drone Unavailable"

3) Combat Drone Reload

Currently, the combat drone only has one mag loaded into the gun and once that is empty the drone becomes useless.
Make it so the drone reloads when the gun is empty and have that take about 5 seconds.

If impossible let me know and leave it as is.

4) Bomb Drone flicker between hidden and visible

Exactly as the title. Have the drone swap between being visible and hidden every 5 seconds.
Make it adjustable 0 - 20s

Ensure it is unaffected by the altitude visible and hidden mechanic for the other Drones.

5) Combat Drone can be Disarmed

You can disarm the Combat Drone. If possible disable this.
If you cannot do that leave it as it is.

6) Picking up Notification

https://gyazo.com/6be79ec56380b176629d77ce657570d0

Change the description to say:

"You may redeploy the Recon Drone Immediately."
"You may redeploy the Combat Drone Immediately."
"You may redeploy the Bomb Drone Immediately."

Change the image used to: DroneAvaliable.png

7) Make it possible for me to give each specific drone only a role as well.

What the title says. 
Drone Operator would have access to all of them but some roles will also have access to the Recon Drone only.
Make it possible to give each individual drone while also keeping the current variable that allows for all drones access.
