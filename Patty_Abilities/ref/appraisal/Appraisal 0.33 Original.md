1) Zeus Respawn Module not being reactivated

It was deleted when the Counter-Attack started but it was not brought back when I ended the Counter-Attack.

I also noticed that the Respawn Module is placed in the Zeus Interface but I can't spawn there when in the Respawn Screen.

2) Default Respawn Marker Visible

You can see the default respawn marker on the map under the custom icon.
Not sure if it's possible but I'd like to hide that so that only the custom icon is visible

If you look behind the custom icon you can see the blue default Respawn icon.
That is what I want hidden.

3) Rally Point name change

It should say "Rally Point (Role)"

As in if the Squad Leader role places the Rally Point it would say "Rally Point (Squad Leader)"

4) Notifications text change

Text for the Notification I tweaked a little.
I've written what it should say for each Notification

Placed = Rally Point Placed
Moved = Rally Point Moved
Contested = Rally Point Contested

| New Addition |

1) 3D & Map Marker for Default Rally Point

Automatically create a 3D and Map Marker for the Default Respawn Point placed with Zeus.

2) Allow the Default Rally Point to be Contested.

No notification for anybody but make it turn Red on the map like normal.
If the players notice they will likely have a panic attack which is the idea.
