1) Cooldowns not functioning ( Mod Compatibility )

Description:    The cooldown preventing the players from placing the same drone immediately is not functioning properly because of a mod compatibility issue.
                The player can place the same drone despite said drone being on cooldown.
                The issue is occurring because of the mod: Simplex Support Services [DEV BUILD]

Recreation:     Have another player use the Drone ability. 
                Destroy the placed drone and ask the player to try to place the same drone again.
                If its broken the player should be able to place the same drone again despite being on cooldown. 
                You cannot recreate this issue alone.

RPT:            Ive already sent you multiple RPT files of the issue occurring naturally during normal gameplay. 
                I highly suggest referring to those if needed. 
                Ive included one more RPT file from one of the tests where I was splitting the modpack up to find the problem maker.

Image/Video:    I cannot provide this as Im unable to recreate the issue on my own.
                The issue is fully streamed in multiple different vods from a user who plays the role that has the ability.
                Below is a link to that same stream but you will need to do a little digging to find the moments the drone is used.

Solution:       I cant tell you exactly what part of the mod causes the incompatibility so you will need to do some digging and create a compatibility for these two mods.
                What I can do is provide the GitHub link to the source code which you can then investigate to figure out the cause.
