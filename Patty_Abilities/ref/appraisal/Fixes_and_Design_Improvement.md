Alright here is my list of things that need to be fixed/added.
Improvement on the design is also in this list just so you are aware.

(1)

The Placement GUI seems to be only a Hint notification that does not go away upon the crate being placed.
I'd like for you to improve the look of this GUI. Below is a screenshot of the ACE GUI for building that you can use as a reference.

You don't need anything crazy but do make it have some consistency with the Role Manager and Life Manager Design.

(2)

Players cannot stop the destruction timer by being close to the crate when enemies are close to it.
I believe this is something I mentioned when creating the contesting feature.

--> Not mentioned in the document you sent me <--

There also needs to be a sound when the crate is being contested that only the person who owns the crate can hear.
The notification is fine but a sound would be perfect as well.

(3)

There are no sounds for when the crate is available to be placed again.
There needs to be a sound for this as well. Maybe also a notification for the Ability owner as well.

(4)

I'd like for you to change the icon for the Resupply crate to the one we used for our old crate:

(5) 

The icon and name on the map need to be changed as well.

It should show up as a Resupply Crate for all players.
You should also be able to see who owns the crate by hovering over it which will display the ingame name of the person that owns the crate.

Here is an example from our old crate you can use as a Reference:

(6)

The 3D icon that is displayed should also be the same as the one shown on the map. It should say Resupply Crate with Yellow color.
The icon itself should be white as in the picture in (5)

(7)

The interaction within ACE should also have the same icon as stated above and should say "Resupply Loadout"

(8)

Animations for Resupplying that I found:

MountOptic
MountSide

MountOptic ends before 10 seconds and would likely need to be slowed down.
MountSide plays longer than 10 seconds so it would need to be sped up to look right.

I'll leave it to you to choose which one you prefer.
