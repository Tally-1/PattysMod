1) Resupply Crate can resupply friendly vehicles.

If a vehicle not currently occupied by the enemy is close to the Resupply Crate a new ACE option will pop up that says "Resupply Vehicle"

This will function exactly the same as Resupply option but upon completion will rearm the vehicle closest to the crate to the maximum.

I usually customise what weapons and how much ammuniton is avaliable for each vehicle before the mission so make sure that upon Resupply it does not reset the weapons and ammunition back to default.
