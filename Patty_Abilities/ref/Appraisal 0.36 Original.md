1) Contested Bug

The Map Marker does not turn red and says Contested for both the Default Rally Point and the player-placed Rally Point.

3) Rework of the Rally Point Placed visual feedback

Did some consistency checks with the Resupply Crate and I've decided to make some visual changes.
I'd like for you to remove the Placed Notification and keep it consistent with Resupply by playing the beeping noises that play when the Crate is placed.

No more notification when completed. 
just the same sound effects that play for the Resupply crate upon completion.

4) Incorrect Contested Text 

The text displayed in the notification for when the Rally Point is contested is not correct.

This is what it should be saying:

Contested: Rally Point Contested!
Contested Description: Rally Point is now Disabled!
