A life system where the Admin can easily set the number of default lives for each player in the addon options. All players should be able to open a menu to see the lives of all players including their own and should be able to also press a button to simply be notified about the amount of lives they have left.

The life menu itself should have 4 buttons that all players can see but may be grayed out depending on the role the player is playing.

Add - Give the selected player a life

Remove -  Remove 1 life from the selected player

Transfer - Transfer one life from yourself to the selected player

Reset -  Reset all lives for all players back to the Default Life amount

Add/Remove/Reset can only be used by Admin.

Transfer can be used by the Combat Medic Which I'll talk about more below.

The Life menu should also display who the Combat Medic is with an icon that represents a Medic.

EXTRA NOTE

The old system used the ingame Ticket system to give each of us 5 lives. I would prefer using that again but if you believe there is a better System you can implement feel free to do that instead after explaining it to me first.
