1) Feature that tells Admin how many lives a player had before disconnecting

Some members may crash and have to reconnect and when they rejoin the server they get all their lives back without problem.
I'd like for you to create a feature that simply tells the admin how many lives a player had before they disconnected/crashed.
That way when they return won't be any guesswork or issues in that area.

An even better option is to make it automatically set the correct amount of lives for the player when they rejoin without the Admin needing to do anything.

2) Give Player Lives on Counter-Attack completion

If a player is eliminated and unable to respawn they can only return if the Medic gives them a life or if a Counter-Attack is completed.
Currently, I give 1 life to those who are eliminated so they can respawn without a problem.

I'd like to automate this process by making it so that if a player is eliminated they will be given 1 life so they can respawn when a Counter-Attack is completed.
You likely will need to send me a command to put into the Counter-Attack script again so let me know and I'll take care of that.

3) Give the specific role a life on Counter-Attack Completion

Similar to 3 I want to be able to grant a life to a specific role when a Counter-Attack is over.
Once again I'd like this to be something I can put into the Counter-Attack end script I got going.

In my group, the Combat Medic is granted a life each time we survive a Counter-Attack hence why I'm asking for this as I want to automate it.

4) Infinite life transfer glitch

Players with the Transfer Lives ability seem to not be stopped from transferring lives when they don't have any.
This causes them to go into - Lives and still be able to give the target Lives.

The image is after I tried giving the lives back.
That's why you won't see the - Lives I mentioned.

| Extra Information |

3 and 4 should be fully controlled in my Counter-Attack script if possible or at least activated in those files to avoid confusing people using the Life Manager in the workshop.

1 should be an add-on option that can be enabled or disabled.
