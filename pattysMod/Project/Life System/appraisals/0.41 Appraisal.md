I'll also need you to make some small changes to the Life Manager. I'll of course pay for the time it takes to implement the changes

1) Currently the default lives are 5. With it turning yellow and orange and then red when it gets lower and lower.
   The only way to change when the color and image is by opening up the mod and changing it. Requiring you to repack and post it as a new update.
   I obviously want it to be as customizable as needed for those who choose to install the mod. 
   My group recently decided to reduce our default lives to 3 from 5. But this causes our lives to start with yellow text which I can't change ingame.

   I'd like for you to add options within the Addon Options that will allow me to set when the color and image changes directly in the addon options.
   It should be a slider for each stage in the life manager. One for Yellow one for Orange and one for Red.
   The slider goes up to the same amount as the life counter goes up to "100"

2) When the life count exceeds 5 lives the image displayed when checking lives or when respawning doesn't show up at all. 
   I'm assuming it's only checking for if you have 5 lives and if it goes higher it's unable to determine what image to display.
   I hope you can fix that so anything higher than the default lives set will always display as Green.
