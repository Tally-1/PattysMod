Life Manager

1) The icon that is displayed for Reset all Lives seems to have an orange tint on it. 
   I checked the file and discovered the _color section is applied onto the image causing this tint. 
   The other images don't share that same _color in the script so my assumption is removing that will likely fix it.

2) The Health State sliders only go down to 1. Because of this, I can't set the Red state to 0.
   I need to be able to drag the sliders down to 0.
3) The new addition that allows me to set when the icon changes seem to only affect the actual icon and not the amount of lives in the menu.
   What I had in mind here was for both the status icon and the life amount to be set by the sliders in the menu.

4) I'd like for you to make some adjustments to the Addon options for the Life Manager.

   First of all, I want you to change the category name to "PA - Life Manager" 
   The image below shows what I mean.

   Then I want you to change the names of the Admin UID and Privileged UID to the ones in the image below

   I also want the descriptions of these addon options slightly adjusted.
   Screenshots below.

5) Change the Default Keybind to check lives to J instead of H.
   We use ACE Medical and the Healing Menu pops up when pressing H.
