Discoverd a few bugs with the Life Manager that i hope you can quickly fix for me Tally.

I also have some new features that i'd like for you to add as options in the menu suggested by other members and by me.

The Life manager breaks the ACE Arsenal scroll bar by making the entire bar white so you can see where the drag bar is. I've tested with just ACE CBA and the Life Manager and the issue persisted.
Let me know if you need any other testing but this is high priority as it currently makes it impossible to see where the scroll bar is.

When the Admin presses Reset all Lives the notification will show up multiple times.
The amount of times it shows up depends on the player count. 
So if there is 6 players the notification for all lives being reset will show up 6 times.

Admin does not get a notification when they reset all lives only the other players.
