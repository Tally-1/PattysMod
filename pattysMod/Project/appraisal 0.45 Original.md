| Life Manager Feature Removal / Feature Rework |

1) Automatically Providing Lives

Scrap and entirely delete any code related to automatically giving lives to the Players.
The only way anybody should gain lives is if the Admin or Medic provides lives using the Life Manager.
Similar to the first iterations of the Life Manager.

2) Life Amount Notification

Delete any code related to detecting life amount when a player disconnects.
When a player leaves in the future, provide a notification for Admin/Zeus mentioning the number of lives the player had before leaving/crashing

Notification: Patty had 5 Lives

| Life Manager New Features |

1) Separate Squads into Categories

Similar to the Role Manager.
Detect every player squad that exists and separate them into categories within the life manager with the exact name of the Squad.
Players can change a squad's name so that they can detect name changes.

Life Manager gets overwhelmed with player names, so separating them into categories that can be minimized and extended will significantly help the organization and medics/admins.
