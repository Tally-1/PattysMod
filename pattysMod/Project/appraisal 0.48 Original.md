1) Cooldown on button presses

Opening the menu and pressing the life buttons should all have a short cooldown to prevent any errors.
Menu opening cooldown should be 3 seconds and life buttons should be 2 seconds

2) Global Menu updating

Lets revert it back to the old way.
Only update the menu visually on client like before meaning people will need to close and open the menu again to see the latest menu information.
The odds of somebody being in the menu when somebody is using it to modify lives is really low and is easily solveable by just reopening the menu.

Im asking for this to prevent that menu freeze that occurs for a split second when any players lives are modified to make it more smooth.
This could also be related to the split seconde delay of information load when opening the menu which makes it seem laggy.

3) Notification Text Rework

Rewriting of Notifications provided within the Life Manager.
Trying to make the notifications more consistent.

Life Amount Notification:

This Notification Specicially is related to both the Player Requested Hint and the Respawn Notification.
Both should have the same text below.

This one is for when the player has specifcally 1 life left.
