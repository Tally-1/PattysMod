1) Change the ACE interaction option name from Role Menu to Role Manager.
    I tried this myself for my group and found it to look a lot better overall.

2) My members including me don't like the font change showing the people who are currently playing a role.
I'd like for you to change the font and reduce the text size to normal values so it's not as large as it is now.

I've sent an image below.

   Use this font but adjust the color strength and make it somewhat fit the little menu nicely as well.
