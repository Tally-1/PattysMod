Everything I'd like changed is listed below:
<!-- [1]: I noticed that the Role Manager won't show up if you start a singleplayer session. I do a lot of testing on a Dev world usually in singleplayer so for convenience, I'd love for that to be fixed. -->

<!-- [2]: The icon that shows up when the role is unavailable is nice but not something I'd like. Instead, keep the normal icon selected in the config and gray out the option as you do now. -->

<!-- [3]: I was unable to setup my custom loadouts when using the new config. Considering it works with the default settings I'm gonna assume I messed up somewhere.

Regards I'd love it if you could make it a little more convenient for me by allowing me to easily just export the loadout from the ACE Arsenal and copy it into the correct spot in the config.

Dom's version does pretty much exactly that but requires the user to change the [] to {} within the exported loadout. I tried to mimic that with the Role Manager but got an error instead.

Cant send a full picture but here is an example of how it's done with Dom's version: -->

<!-- [4]: We don't use the Arsenal blacklist/Whitelist in the config at all. A nice feature but I'd much rather create a separate mod than set all that in the config. I'd prefer it if you remove that entire feature in the Config and anywhere else in the Role Manager.
That's everything I got. Once you send me the next addition I'll run tests at the latest Monday should you get back to me tomorrow with a new version. -->
