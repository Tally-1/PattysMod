Alright here is a proper list of all the things I'd like you to fix before completion:

1) Role Manager seems to require Life Manager to work. When loaded with Life Manager it breaks the "Role Manager" Text at the top. 
   The menu also breaks if the Life Manager is not loaded by preventing any of the buttons from appearing

   The Role Manager is not meant to require the Life Manager to work so I'd like for that to be fixed fully so that no buttons or text is missing when loaded alone or with the Life Manager.

2) As mentioned in my previous messages the black background does not cover the entire menu as it grows when it opens.
   I don't like how it looks so I'd like for the black background to also extend with the edges so that the entire menu has a background and not just the middle part.
