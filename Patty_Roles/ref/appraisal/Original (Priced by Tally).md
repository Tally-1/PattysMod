Comment:
I am not familiar with the ingame ticket system, however it seems like a practical way of going about it.
Alternatively I'd build a similar system from scratch.
Keeping the old menu style should not be an issue.

Comment:
The Role system GUI and mechanics are slightly more complex than the life systems.
Hence they will take a bit longer to complete.
I get the overall concept of your Idea, and I think I'd build a start-version
And then we could hammer out the smaller details once you see V.1
Mimicing the original style should not be a problem

Comment:
I did not include the grenadier as I do not know how to deactivate mines only for some units.
It is not impossible but I fear the time spent figuring it out would be to much.
The same issue also goes for the Zone-capture for the combat medic.
